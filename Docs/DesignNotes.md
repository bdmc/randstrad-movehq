## Design Notes

As a way to "jump-start" the design of this project, I chose the
current version of Drupal, 9, and its Quick Start method of
starting a local, PHP-based server, rather than the more
heavyweight Apache2 server that would be used in the
production environment.

*I have always liked Drupal, I find the structure very clear
and understandable and the code very readable.  However,
as I say later, the changes from version to version
are significant enough that I was not able to learn what
I needed to for this task.*

I have created custom modules for earlier versions of Drupal,
in the past.  However, I needed to spend some time learning how
to do so in Drupal 9.  The differences in concepts and
implementations is too different from what I have used in
the past.

*I have probably shot myself in more than one foot by choosing
to use Drupal 9 as my foundation.*

Regarding the choice of database, the Drupal Quick Start process
uses SQLITE for its local database serving the PHP local server,
but in a production environment, I would choose
PostgreSQL, but could use MySQL or MariaDB as well.

*Finally -- I have spent FAR too much time on this "project",
5 1/2 hours today, at least that long on Saturday, and some
on Friday.  There is no point in continuing, because I am not
accomplishing what you asked.*
