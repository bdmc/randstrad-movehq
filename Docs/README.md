# Test Project for Randstrad and MoveHQ

#### The initial step was done using the "New Repository" function in GitHub, which automatically created this README.md file.

#### The overall structure of this progam will use Drupal as a framework, and its Quick Start function to create a working local development web site, using PHP's built-in web browser, rather than using an external server and Apache2, which would be used for production.

*I have always liked Drupal, I find the structure very clear and understandable and the code very readable.*

You may refer to [Quick Start](Docs/DrupalQuickStart.md) for a description of the steps described there, which I modified, to perform a Drupal Quick Start.  The full Drupal Quick Start page is: [Drupal Quick Start Command](https://www.drupal.org/docs/installing-drupal/drupal-quick-start-command), where we are told: `Important: the quick-start command is intended only for launching a local demo version of Drupal. If you need to install Drupal for production use, see instructions in the rest of this guide.`

The procedure that I followed for creating this project and repository can be found in: [SetUp](Docs/Setup.md).  I modified the procedure described in Drupal's Quick Start guide for my needs.  I used the Quick Start commands to "create" or "fill in" the base code for this repository.

#### The Drupal installation overwrote my original README.md file, so I have created this copy in Docs.
